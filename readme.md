# FPGA-Based Digital Logic Design Using Verilog HDL 🚀

This repository contains introductory experiments in **FPGA synthesis and simulation** using Verilog HDL.  
The goal of this project is to practice writing, synthesizing, and testing basic **combinational and sequential circuits** on FPGA platforms.

## 🛠 Tools & Environment
- **HDL Language:** Verilog  
- **Synthesis Tool:** Xilinx Vivado (basic synthesis flow)  
- **Simulation:** Vivado Simulator / ModelSim

## 🔧 Implemented Modules
1. **Adder (`adder.v`)**
   - Simple 2-bit adder with carry.  
2. **Counter (`counter.v`)**
   - Synchronous counter with reset functionality.  
3. **Finite State Machine (`fsm.v`)**
   - Basic FSM example (Moore/Moore type).  
4. **Parallel Adder (`paralleladder.v`)**
   - N-bit parallel adder design using multiple full adders.  
5. **SR Latch (`sr_latch.v`)**
   - Basic SR latch implementation using NOR/ NAND gates.

## 📊 Results
- Verified functionality via **simulation waveforms**.  
- Successfully synthesized designs with no critical warnings.  
- Example waveform:

## 📌 Future Work
- Expand with additional modules (multipliers, shift registers).  
- Experiment with timing analysis and resource utilization reports.  
- Test on physical FPGA development boards (e.g., Xilinx Artix-7, Intel Cyclone).
